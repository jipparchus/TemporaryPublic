## MScProject_temporary_public.py
-- This is a part of python script I am working on now (22/02/2023). The part uploaded on GitHub is all written by myself. The main function of the programme is:
1. Download .fits format data taken by instruments called AIA on board of Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO) satellite.
2. Load the data and save as pickle binary file.
3. Use the image data and the header information to spot and investigate phenomena on the Sun.
4. Plot the analysis summary.

Belows are the example plot generated by the code.
