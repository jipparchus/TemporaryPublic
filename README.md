# MSc Project

## MScProject_temporary_public.py
-- This is a part of python script I am working on now (22/02/2023). The part uploaded on GitHub is all written by myself. The main function of the programme is:
1. Download .fits format data taken by instruments called AIA on board of Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO) satellite.
2. Load the data and save as pickle binary file.
3. Use the image data and the header information to spot and investigate phenomena on the Sun.
4. Plot the analysis summary.

Belows are the example plot generated by the code.

## SpeedUp_temporary_public.py
-- A part of code I used to learn and test about python multi-processing and multi-threading.

# Hobby

## RaspberryGardenTelescope
-- A code written to depelpop a software for stargazing and astrophotography as a part of my hobby. This is a very simple code to find stars from a picture.

## MaksyPi.py
-- This is also a part of the hobby about astrophotography. Using my spare time, I have been working on software to map deep sky object for a given date depending on the observer's location and the altitude. Another function to capture live video from Raspberry Pi HQ camera is not completed yet.

The UI looks like belows:
